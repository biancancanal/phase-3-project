# Tasks

Go [here](https://mod-4-week-1-todo.herokuapp.com/) to view the demo. Toggle the stretch features on/off using the button in the top right of the page.

The `tasks` are hardcoded into the state of `App` and the `categories` are imported into `App`, use these to display the category filter buttons.

You will need to add something else to the state of `App` to track which category has been selected.

All the css is included in `src/App.css`, just make sure your classes are correct (but don't worry about the styling too much!).

## Strech goals

- Add an X button to delete a task.
- Add a form to add a new task.
